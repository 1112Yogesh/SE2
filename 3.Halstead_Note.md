## Program Metrics

| Symbol                       | Description                                |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **N₁**                       | Number of operators in the program         |
| **N₂**                       | Number of operands in the program          |
| **η₁**                       | Number of unique operators                 |
| **η₂**                       | Number of unique operands                  |
| **η = η₁ + η₂**              | Program Vocabulary                         |
| **N = N₁ + N₂**              | Program Length                             |
| **V = N × log₂(η)**          | Program Volume                             |
| **D = (η₁ / 2) × (N₂ / η₂)** | Program Difficulty                         |
| **L = 1 / D**                | Program Level                              |
| **E = D × V**                | Program Effort (in mental discriminations) |
| **B = V / 3000**             | Estimated number of delivered bugs         |

## Interpretation

- **Effort (E)** represents the total number of _mental discriminations_ required to implement the program.
- A higher **Effort** indicates greater complexity and potential for errors.

## Counting Rules for Halstead Metrics

When defining how to count operators and operands, maintain consistency:

- Do you count `;` and `,` as operators?
- Do you treat paired reserved words as distinct operators (e.g., `{}`, `()`, `if–then`, `begin–end`)?
- Do you count syntactical markers like `end if`, `end loop`, etc.?
- Do you treat unary and binary operators (e.g., `-x` vs. `x - y`) as the same or distinct?

## Halstead’s Effort (E) and Schneider’s Effort

- **Halstead’s E** is measured in _discriminations per second_ (a measure of mental activity).
- The **Stroud number** = 18 discriminations/second (average human processing rate).

To convert **Halstead’s E** to **Schneider’s E** (discriminations per month), use the correction factor:

\[
18 \text{ discriminations/sec} × 60 \text{ sec/min} × 60 \text{ min/hr} × 8 \text{ hr/day} × 17 \text{ day/month}
\]

\[
= 8,812,800 \text{ discriminations/month}
\]

So,

\[
E*{Schneider} = \frac{E*{Halstead}}{8,812,800}
\]

## Summary

- **Halstead’s metrics** quantify software complexity through measurable program elements (operators and operands).
- **Volume (V)** indicates size, **Difficulty (D)** measures complexity, and **Effort (E)** reflects cognitive effort.
- These metrics can also estimate **bugs (B)** and overall **development effort**.
