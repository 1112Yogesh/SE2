McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity

In the control flow graph for a procedure reachable from the main procedure containing
N nodes, E edges, p connected procedures

- only procedures that are reachable from the main procedure
    V(G) = E – N + 2p


Does p allow analysis of a collection of programs?

programs with nested functions

typically only look at a single program rather
than a “library” with many disconnected
routines

Herraiz and Hassan (2011) use the maximum or average cyclomatic complexity for all functions in a file.



Recommended Ranges for Cyclomatic Complexity
V(G) should be less than 10
commonly accepted range Mathur recommends less than 5
Some suggest that 10-20 should be classified as “challenging”
